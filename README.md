a mix between the bartering and monetary systems, designed to see if it could be better for the economy if it were like this

a ʇ is a unit, and each item is valued in units based on its
ppm in the earth's crust, lower ppms becoming higher ʇs. the
conversion between ppm and ʇ is the reciprocal of ppm / 1000000.

to figure out something's value in units, first figure out
what percentage of the object is made up of what elements.
input the weight of the object, the elements that the object
consists of, and the percentages of each element in the object.

then divide the value by avogadro's number * 100000 and round it off to the hundredths place
